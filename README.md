# 💊 Machine Learning Medication App

This project is a smart healthcare web/mobile application that uses **Machine Learning** to predict possible diseases based on user-inputted **symptoms**, and recommends relevant **medications**.This is a smart healthcare web application that uses a Machine Learning model to predict the most probable disease based on user-inputted symptoms and provides relevant healthcare suggestions including medications, diets, and precautions.

## 🌟 Features

- 🤒 Input symptoms through a simple text form (comma-separated)
- 🧬 Predict diseases using a pre-trained Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- 💊 Suggest medications, diets, and workout plans
- 🔐 Built-in support for multiple datasets including symptom severity and disease descriptions
- 👨‍⚕️ Future enhancement: contact a doctor or consult a chatbot
- 📊 Easy-to-understand results on the same web page

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### ✅ Requirements

Make sure Python 3.7+ is installed. You can install dependencies using:
pip install flask pandas numpy scikit-learn
🚀 Run the App

# If using app.py
python app.py

# OR if using main.p
python main.p
Then open your browser and go to:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/
🧠 How It Works
User enters symptoms (e.g., fatigue, headache, vomiting)

The app:
Converts symptoms to a binary feature vector using symptoms_dict
Uses the pre-trained SVC model (svc.pkl) to predict the disease
Relevant information is retrieved:
Description from description.csv
Precautions from precautions_df.csv
Medications from medications.csv
Diet from diets.csv
Workouts from workout_df.csv
Output is displayed on the same page.

🔮 Example Input
Symptoms: fatigue, headache, vomiting
Predicted Disease: Migraine
Suggestions:

Description: A headache of varying intensity, often accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to light and sound.
Precautions: Avoid triggers, take rest, stay hydrated, use cold compress.
Medications: Ibuprofen, Sumatriptan
Diet: Avoid caffeine, eat at regular intervals
Workout: Light yoga/stretching

(Optional: Add screenshots of your UI here)

📈 Future Improvements
Add chatbot or teleconsultation feature
Add confidence score from the model
Mobile app integration using REST API
Dynamic symptom suggestions using autocomplete
Improve UI/UX with animations or design libraries
