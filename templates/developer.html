        <h2>About the Developers</h2>

        <h5>Meet the Creators</h5>
        <p>This project was proudly developed by <strong>Rachana</strong> and <strong>Preethika</strong>, Computer Science students passionate about using technology for real-world impact.</p>

        <h5>Our Journey</h5>
        <p>As students, we always believed in the power of learning by doing. This web application is the result of our shared curiosity in Artificial Intelligence, Web Development, and Health Technology. It began as a project for academic purposes, but we hope it becomes a helpful tool for many.</p>

        <h5>Why We Built This</h5>
        <p>We noticed how difficult it can be for people to understand their symptoms or get quick health insights. So we built a platform that uses AI and a simple interface to help users get an idea of potential health issues — all through technology and research we’ve learned during our studies.</p>

        <h5>Our Goals</h5>
        <p>Our goal is to not only complete a project but to create something meaningful. We wanted to apply our classroom knowledge in machine learning, data analysis, and frontend development into something that can contribute to people’s well-being.</p>

        <h5>A Note from Us</h5>
        <p>Thank you for visiting our project! We’re always learning and growing, and we hope to keep building more tools that make a difference. If you have feedback, suggestions, or just want to say hi — feel free to connect with us!</p>
